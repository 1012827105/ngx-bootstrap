The **sortable component** represents a list of items, with ability to sort them or move to another container via drag&drop. This component supports touch devices. Input collection isn't mutated by the component, so events <code>ngModelChange</code>, <code>itemsChange</code> are using new collections. It is possible to use simple <code>Sortable</code> component if you need to sort just text values or to attach directives to html elements and use arbitrary template for items in list.
